You are a senior UX engineer. Update the PNW Cloud Services site to standardize our conversion CTAs and clarify the difference between “quick consult” (modal) vs “long-form contact” (dedicated Contact page). Do NOT change routing or page layout drastically—this is a copy + CTA + small UI consistency pass.

GOALS
1) All CTAs across the site use one consistent phrase:
   - Primary CTA label: “Schedule a Free Consultation”
2) Clicking any “Schedule a Free Consultation” CTA should open the existing consultation modal (do not navigate away).
3) The Contact page should clearly position the on-page form as the “long-form / detailed” option, while the modal is the “quick intro” option.
4) Reduce redundancy on the Contact page: the bottom scheduling section should not compete with the main form.

SCOPE / IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Search the codebase for all CTA button labels and normalize them to “Schedule a Free Consultation”.
- Ensure header button uses this label and opens the existing modal.
- Ensure any “Schedule Consultation”, “Schedule a Consultation”, “Schedule Appointment”, “Talk to a Platform Expert”, etc. are replaced with the standard label and wired to the same modal open handler.
- Ensure there is only ONE scheduling entry point: the modal.
- Keep the dedicated Contact page form for longer context and submissions.

CONTACT PAGE CHANGES (client/src/pages/contact.tsx or equivalent)
A) Update hero title/subtitle copy to clarify intent:
   - Keep the page title “Let’s Connect”
   - Update the subtitle to: “Prefer to share more detail? Send us a message below. If you’d rather start with a quick intro, schedule a free consultation.”
B) Update the form section heading:
   - Change “Send us a message” to “Tell us about your project”
C) Add a short helper line above the form fields (small text):
   - “This form is best if you want to provide context up front. If you prefer, you can also schedule a free consultation.”
   - The phrase “schedule a free consultation” should be a link/button that opens the same modal.
D) Bottom scheduling section:
   - Replace the “Schedule Appointment” card/section with a simple, secondary CTA block (no pricing).
   - Suggested content:
     - Title: “Want to move faster?”
     - Body: “Schedule a free 20-minute consultation and we’ll align on goals, constraints, and next steps.”
     - Button: “Schedule a Free Consultation” (opens modal)
   - Ensure this block is visually secondary to the main form (smaller header, lighter styling, less prominence than the form).

MODAL CHANGES (wherever the modal component lives)
- Modal title should remain “Schedule a Consultation” OR update to “Schedule a Free Consultation” (choose whichever is already used in the UI, but make it consistent with CTA label).
- If there are multiple modal titles/subtitles, standardize them to:
  - Title: “Schedule a Free Consultation”
  - Subtitle: “Share a few details and we’ll follow up to coordinate a quick 20-minute intro.”

GLOBAL CTA AUDIT
- Grep/search for all occurrences of:
  “Schedule Consultation”
  “Schedule a Consultation”
  “Schedule Appointment”
  “Talk to a Platform Expert”
  “Talk to an Expert”
  “Book”
  “Get in touch” (when used as a scheduling CTA)
- Replace their button text with “Schedule a Free Consultation” where the intent is scheduling.
- Do not change “Contact” navigation label (nav item can remain “Contact”).
- For non-scheduling CTAs that truly mean “submit the contact form”, use “Send Message” or “Submit” only inside the form.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
1) Every scheduling CTA across the site displays exactly: “Schedule a Free Consultation”.
2) Clicking any scheduling CTA opens the same consultation modal.
3) Contact page clearly differentiates: long-form message form vs quick consult modal.
4) No pricing is displayed anywhere in the consultation area.
5) Mobile and desktop both look clean and consistent; no overflowing buttons or broken spacing.

After changes:
- Run the app and verify all CTAs open the modal.
- Verify Contact form still submits via Formspree unchanged.
- Provide a short checklist of files changed and where you found/updated the CTAs.
