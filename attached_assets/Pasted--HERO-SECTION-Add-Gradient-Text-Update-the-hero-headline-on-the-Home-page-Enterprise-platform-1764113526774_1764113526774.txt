. HERO SECTION — Add Gradient Text

Update the hero headline on the Home page:

"Enterprise platforms that power AI, efficiency, and growth."

Enhancements:

Apply a soft multicolor gradient similar to the “Product thinking.” text from the reference screenshot I provided.

Suggested gradient: soft purple → pink → warm orange (very subtle, enterprise-friendly).

Keep the second line (if split) in solid dark text for contrast.

Ensure gradient affects text only, not background.

2. AI ACCENT COLOR LOGIC

Introduce a unified accent color scheme:

Any tag, badge, icon, or phrase involving “AI”, “Automation,” or “Machine Learning” should use a soft purple accent (#7A5AF8 or nearest match to your palette).

Apply this to:

AI service page tags

Blog AI category chip

AI Automation page section headers

Any callouts specifically referring to AI

This should be subtle. Do NOT oversaturate.

3. CTA UNIIFICATION + MODAL CONVERSION
A. Standardize CTA Text

Replace all variations with a single unified version:

➡️ “Schedule a Consultation”

Check ALL locations:

Header

Home page

Footer

Blog cards (if any)

Contact page

Any buttons generated in services pages

B. Convert CTA → Modal

When a user clicks Schedule a Consultation, open a modal instead of navigating to the Contact page.

The modal should contain the existing contact form, including:

Name

Business email

Company

Job title

How did you hear about us?

Project description

Submit button

Modal design guidelines:

White background

Soft drop shadow

Slight rounded corners (12–16px)

Close button (X) in top right

Prevent background scrolling while open

Make the modal responsive for mobile

Keep the standalone Contact page available via the nav link.

4. UPDATE CONSULTATION INFO

Apply these global changes wherever consultation messaging appears:

Remove the $99 pricing entirely from the site.

Replace any consultation time references with:
“Free 20-minute consultation.”

Update the Contact page block that references appointment scheduling.
