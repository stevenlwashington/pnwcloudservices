## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Framework/Stack
- Use React with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-responsive (breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl)
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Lazy load images/animations where appropriate

### Performance
- Optimize SVG animations (use CSS transforms)
- Minimize repaints
- Fast load times (<3s)

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Pink gradient = Metrics ONLY** - Never use pink for anything except numbers/data
2. **Blue-green gradient = Hover states** - Consistent across ALL interactive elements
3. **Light backgrounds** - Use light mint, NOT dark green for main sections
4. **Business outcomes over technical features** - Copy emphasizes ROI, speed, talent
5. **Progressive disclosure** - Picker allows users to self-select their journey
6. **Visual hierarchy** - Clear distinction between primary/secondary elements
7. **Subtle animations** - Enhance UX without being distracting

---

## DELIVERABLE

A fully functional, responsive Platform Modernization page that:
- Implements all copy exactly as specified
- Follows color system rules precisely
- Includes all animations and interactions
- Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- Matches the design intent described above

**Output:** Single-page React component with Tailwind CSS, ready to deploy.
