Please update the homepage hero section to use a three-line layout and optimized spacing for the main headline.

Requirements

Hero text content

Keep the hero headline text exactly as:

Engineering Speed Business Confidence

But render it on three lines like this:

Line 1: Engineering

Line 2: Speed

Line 3: Business Confidence

Do not include periods at the end of any line.

Gradient on “Speed”

Keep the existing gradient treatment on the word “Speed.”
It should remain wrapped in the gradient span (e.g., <span className="gradient-word">Speed</span> or similar).
Only the word “Speed” should have the gradient; “Engineering” and “Business Confidence” should stay solid dark green.

Implementation details

In the hero component (likely client/src/components/home/hero.tsx or similar), change the heading so that:

Each part of the headline is either:

separated by <br /> tags, or

wrapped in block-level spans (e.g., <span className="hero-line"> with display: block).

The visual result should show each phrase on its own row on both desktop and mobile:

Engineering

Speed (gradient word)

Business Confidence

Vertical spacing between lines

Adjust the spacing using margins or line-height so that:

Between “Engineering” and “Speed”
Spacing is slightly tighter (about 0.65em of the hero font size).
This should visually indicate that “Engineering” and “Speed” belong together.

Between “Speed” and “Business Confidence”
Spacing is a bit larger (about 1.0em of the hero font size) to visually separate the engineering outcome from the business outcome.

You can approximate these with CSS, for example by giving each line a class like .hero-line-top, .hero-line-middle, .hero-line-bottom and applying different margin-bottom values, or by adjusting line-height where appropriate.

Spacing between headline, subtext, and CTA

Keep the existing subtext copy but adjust spacing:

Between the headline block and the subtext:
add comfortable breathing room, about 1.5x the hero font size (margin-top on the subtext or margin-bottom on the heading).

Between the subtext and the primary CTA button:
use medium spacing, around 1.0x the hero font size.

Visually, the hierarchy should feel:

Headline (dominant)

Subtext (clearly separated but still connected)

CTA (close enough to feel like the next logical action)

Responsiveness

Ensure this three-line structure and spacing works well on both desktop and mobile breakpoints.

On mobile, the text can remain left-aligned or centered (whichever matches the existing design), but the three-line structure and relative spacing should be preserved.

Do not change

Do not change the actual text content of the headline, subtext, or CTA.

Do not change colors, fonts, or CTA label (“Talk to a Platform Expert”) unless required by the spacing adjustments.

Do not alter other sections of the homepage.
