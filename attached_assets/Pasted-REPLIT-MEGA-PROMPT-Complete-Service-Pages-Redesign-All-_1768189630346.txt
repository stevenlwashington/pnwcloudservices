MESSAGING & TONE GUIDELINES
Brand Voice
Confident but not arrogant - We know our expertise, but we're here to help, not lecture
Direct and clear - No buzzwords without substance, no jargon without explanation
Business-outcome focused - Always tie technical capabilities to business impact (revenue, retention, velocity)
Foundation-first mindset - Emphasize prerequisites before features, "step zero" work, realistic roadmaps
Responsible execution - Speed matters, but trust and quality matter more
Writing Principles
Lead with outcomes, follow with how - "3x faster deployment" before "microservices architecture"
Avoid over-promising - Use realistic timeframes ("within 6 months" not "overnight transformation")
Speak to executives AND engineers - Balance business language with technical credibility
Use concrete examples - "duplicate fields, conflicting automation rules" vs generic "technical debt"
Acknowledge trade-offs - "Ship faster and safer" acknowledges the typical tension
Make invisible work visible - Call out the foundational work others skip (data cleanup, governance, observability)
Terminology Standards
Use: "Platform," "Developer Experience," "Agent Ecosystems," "Golden Path," "Foundation-First," "Governance by Design"
Avoid: "Digital Transformation" (vague), "Innovation" (overused), "Best-in-class" (meaningless), "Synergy"
Be specific: "DORA metrics," "Agent Force for Sales," "TCPA compliance," "MTTR reduction"
