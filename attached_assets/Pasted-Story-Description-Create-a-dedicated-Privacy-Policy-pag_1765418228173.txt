Story Description
Create a dedicated Privacy Policy page that clearly communicates how user data is collected, stored, protected, and used by PNW Cloud Services. The policy should address data types collected (including form submissions), retention practices, user rights, and the involvement of third-party processors such as Formspree and Cloudflare Turnstile/Recaptcha. The final page must be compliant with common U.S. small-business privacy standards and styled consistently with the existing website.
