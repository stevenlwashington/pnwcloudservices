Replit Mega-Prompt: Update “Humanized” Section (Homepage)

Goal:
Replace the current “Founded by Platform Engineers” section that includes my name/card (“Steven Washington – Founder”) with a higher-trust, brand-safe section that does NOT include any personal name, photo, or individual bio card.

What to build:
1) Section headline (Option A — use exactly):
“Built by Platform Engineering Leaders”

2) Supporting copy (use this verbatim, unless you need minor spacing edits):
“PNW Cloud Services is built by leaders who’ve owned and scaled platform teams across DevOps, CRM, data, and internal tooling—partnering directly with engineers to ship production systems.”

3) Replace the current single-person “Founder” card with a neutral, non-personal trust component.
Implement ONE of these (choose the cleanest visually given the current design system):
- A) A 3-pill “credibility bar” with icons:
  - “Embedded with engineering teams”
  - “Production systems shipped”
  - “Enterprise platform experience”
OR
- B) A 2x2 grid of small cards (no people) with icons:
  - “Platform Modernization”
  - “DevEx & DevOps”
  - “AI & Automation”
  - “Governance & Security”

Design requirements:
- Keep the same background color + spacing rhythm as the rest of the homepage sections.
- Match the existing typography scale (H2/H3 styles) and button styles.
- Improve readability: ensure the paragraph text uses a darker color / higher contrast than the current light gray treatment (increase font weight slightly if needed).
- Center the headline and paragraph as currently done, but ensure the content doesn’t feel empty—use the credibility bar/cards to create visual weight.

Implementation details:
- Find the existing “Founded by Platform Engineers” section component/file and refactor it (do not create a duplicate section).
- Remove any references to:
  - “Steven Washington”
  - “Founder”
  - Any avatar/profile placeholder
- Keep the section’s id/anchor stable if it exists (so nav/links don’t break).
- Ensure it is responsive: looks good on desktop and mobile (stack pills/cards vertically on small screens).

After changes:
- Run the app and confirm the homepage renders with the new section.
- Confirm there is no personal name anywhere in this section.
- Commit the changes with a message like: “Refactor humanized section to platform leadership positioning”
