MEGA PROMPT — PNW Cloud Services: “Insights” section hover + link animations (AWS “What’s new” inspired)

Goal
- Update the homepage “Platform Insights” section so it feels like AWS’s “What’s new” interaction pattern: subtle, premium, confidence-building.
- Add micro-interactions to:
  1) The “View all posts →” link
  2) Each blog card (hover state)
  3) A per-card CTA link (e.g., “Read post →”)
- Keep the design minimal (no gimmicks), accessible, and consistent with the existing brand styling.

Scope
- Only touch the “Insights / Platform Insights / Latest Insights” section component(s) and any shared UI primitives it uses.
- Do not change routing or data source logic (keep whatever is currently used to render the posts).
- Do not introduce a new dependency unless necessary. Prefer Tailwind + small utility components. If framer-motion is already installed, you MAY use it for in-view animations; otherwise implement with IntersectionObserver + Tailwind classes.

Requirements (UX + interaction)
A) Section header link (“View all posts →”)
- On hover/focus:
  - underline should animate in (left-to-right)
  - arrow should translate slightly right (e.g., translate-x-1)
  - transition should be smooth and short (150–200ms)
- On keyboard focus: show visible focus ring and keep the same motion

B) Blog cards (hover/focus-within)
Each card should have these behaviors:
- Card “lifts” slightly: translateY(-2px) and increases shadow a touch
- Image micro-zooms slightly: scale(1.02–1.04)
- Title text subtly darkens (or increases contrast) and/or underline appears
- The per-card CTA link (“Read post →”) animates like AWS:
  - underline reveals left-to-right
  - arrow nudges right on hover/focus
- Entire card should still be clickable (or at least obvious the card is interactive)
- Include :focus-visible styles for accessibility

C) Optional: “in-view” entrance animation (recommended)
- When the section enters viewport, cards should fade in + slide up slightly with a stagger (very subtle).
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if reduced motion is on, disable animations and show everything static.
- Implement either with:
  1) framer-motion (if already present), OR
  2) IntersectionObserver hook and Tailwind transitions.

D) Accessibility / performance
- Keep motion subtle; do not animate layout-heavy properties beyond transform/opacity.
- Add aria-labels if needed for icons/links.
- Ensure text contrast remains readable; do not lighten text.

Implementation details
1) Find the homepage section component that renders “Platform Insights” cards.
   - Common locations: /app/page.tsx, /components/sections/Insights.tsx, /components/home/InsightsSection.tsx
2) Refactor the card markup to have:
   - Outer clickable container (Link) with group and focus-within classes
   - Image wrapper with overflow-hidden and rounded corners
   - Title + meta + CTA link (“Read post →”)
3) Add Tailwind classes for hover/focus states using group-hover/group-focus-visible.
4) Build a small reusable “AnimatedLink” component (optional but recommended) used for:
   - “View all posts →”
   - “Read post →”
   This component should:
   - accept href + children
   - render underline using pseudo-element or a span with scale-x transition
   - animate arrow translate on hover/focus

Concrete Tailwind behaviors to apply (examples; adjust to match site style)
- Card:
  - base: rounded-2xl border bg-white shadow-sm transition-transform transition-shadow duration-200
  - hover: hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-md
  - focus: focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-emerald-700/40
- Image:
  - wrapper: overflow-hidden rounded-xl
  - img: transition-transform duration-300 ease-out group-hover:scale-[1.03]
- Title:
  - transition-colors duration-200 group-hover:text-emerald-950
- CTA underline:
  - use span underline that scales from 0 to 100% with origin-left
- Arrow:
  - transition-transform duration-200 group-hover:translate-x-1

Deliverables
- Updated Insights section with the described micro-interactions.
- Add per-card “Read post →” link (if not already present).
- Ensure reduced-motion is respected.
- Test in desktop + mobile:
  - Hover interactions on desktop
  - Focus interactions via keyboard
  - Mobile should remain clean (no awkward hover artifacts)

Do not
- Do not change the overall page layout order.
- Do not add heavy animations or carousels.
- Do not reduce readability/contrast.

After implementing
- Provide a short summary of changed files and what to visually verify.
- Include before/after screenshots in the Replit preview if possible.
