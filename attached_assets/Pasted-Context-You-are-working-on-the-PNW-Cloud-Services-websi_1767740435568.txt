Context

You are working on the PNW Cloud Services website.
This is an enterprise-focused consulting brand. The audience is senior engineering leaders, platform owners, and executives. The tone must be calm, confident, human-centered, and senior — never pushy, gimmicky, or salesy.

The site must support three distinct user intent flows, all first-class and intentional.

Core UX Model: Three Intent Paths (Priority Order)
Priority 1 — Consult (High Intent, Synchronous)

This is the primary conversion path.

Purpose: book a 20-minute free consultation via Calendly.

This path should feel decisive, confident, and frictionless.

Rules

Calendly integration remains unchanged.

All “Schedule a Consultation” / “Schedule a Free Consultation” CTAs:

Open Calendly directly (new tab or modal, whichever is already implemented).

This CTA should remain:

In the header

In the hero

In the primary bottom-of-page CTA

Priority 2 — Contact (Medium Intent, Asynchronous)

(Key instruction: optimize Contact flow)

This is a separate path from Calendly.

Intent

Users who want to send context, ask a question, or reach out without committing to a meeting.

This path must feel thoughtful, low-pressure, and respectful of time.

Optimize Contact Flow (MANDATORY)

When the instruction “optimize Contact flow” is used, implement the following:

Modal-first Contact Experience

The Contact form must open in a modal, not navigate to a separate page.

The modal should:

Be reusable

Be accessible from anywhere on the site

Preserve scroll position when closed

CTAs that open the Contact modal

“Contact” in the header

Inline “send us a message” links

Secondary CTAs across the site

Footer “Contact” links

Dedicated Contact Page Behavior

The /contact route should still exist for SEO and direct access.

When visited directly, it should:

Render the same Contact form inline

Use identical copy, fields, validation, and submission logic as the modal

No duplicated logic or forked UX.

Relationship to Calendly

The Contact modal must not replace Calendly.

It should gently reference it with secondary inline copy:

Example: “If you’d prefer to start with a quick conversation, schedule a free consultation.”

Calendly is never embedded inside the Contact modal.

Priority 3 — Explore (Low Intent, Trust-Building)

Blog

Expertise pages

Insights

Non-transactional browsing

This path should:

Never interrupt users with forced CTAs

Use subtle inline links instead of buttons

Reinforce credibility and thinking, not conversion pressure

Visual & Interaction Principles

Think river delta, not funnel

Avoid stacking multiple CTAs that compete with each other in the same viewport

One primary action per section

Secondary actions should be visually subordinate (links > buttons)

Hero Section Rules

Headline remains:
Engineering Speed
Business Confidence

“Speed” may retain gradient emphasis

Primary CTA: Schedule a Free Consultation

Secondary CTA (if present): text link → opens Contact modal

Below-the-Fold CTA Rules

Do not present both Calendly and Contact side-by-side in the same block

Use one decisive CTA

Prefer Calendly for bottom-of-page CTAs

Contact should be available, but not visually competing

Contact Form Requirements

Fields remain as currently designed

Lightweight validation

Clear success state (inline confirmation, no page reload)

Uses existing backend integration (Resend, Turnstile if enabled)

Do not introduce Salesforce or heavy CRM tooling

Implementation Notes

Reuse components wherever possible

Modal Contact form must be a shared component

Keep code clean, readable, and production-ready

Do not invent new flows beyond what is specified here

Summary Intent (Non-Negotiable)

This site should feel like:

“A confident platform partner who respects your time, gives you space to think, and meets you exactly where you are.”

No urgency tricks.
No clutter.
No duplicated CTAs.
Everything intentional.
