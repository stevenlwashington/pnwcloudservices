3. ✅ **AI-Powered Productivity & Automation**
4. ✅ **DevEx & DevOps**

## NAVIGATION UPDATES

### 1. Header Navigation Dropdown

**Current State (7 services):**
```
Services ▼
  - Platform Modernization
  - Salesforce & CRM Strategy
  - AI-Powered Productivity & Automation
  - DevEx & DevOps
  - Observability
  - Compliance & Governance
  - Cloud Strategy & Cost Optimization
```

**Updated State (4 services):**
```
Services ▼
  - Platform Modernization
  - Salesforce & CRM Strategy
  - AI-Powered Productivity & Automation
  - DevEx & DevOps
```

**Implementation:**
- Remove the 3 eliminated services from the dropdown menu component
- Ensure dropdown still functions properly with 4 items
- Maintain hover states and active page indicators
- Keep same styling/spacing (adjust if needed for visual balance)

---

### 2. Footer Navigation

**Current Footer Services Column:**
```
Services
  - Platform Modernization
  - Salesforce & CRM Strategy
  - AI-Powered Productivity & Automation
  - DevEx & DevOps
  - Observability
  - Compliance & Governance
  - Cloud Strategy & Cost Optimization
```

**Updated Footer Services Column:**
```
Services
  - Platform Modernization
  - Salesforce & CRM Strategy
  - AI-Powered Productivity & Automation
  - DevEx & DevOps
```

**Implementation:**
- Update footer component to show only 4 services
- Maintain link styling and hover states
- Ensure footer layout remains balanced with fewer items

---

### 3. Homepage Service Cards/Links (If Applicable)

**Action Required:**
- If the homepage has a services section with cards/links to all 7 services, update to show only 4
- Remove cards for: Observability, Compliance & Governance, Cloud Strategy
- Adjust grid layout if needed (e.g., from 3x3 grid to 2x2 grid)
- Maintain visual consistency and spacing

**Note:** If homepage doesn't have service cards, skip this step.

---

## PAGE HANDLING FOR ELIMINATED SERVICES

### Option A: 301 Redirects (RECOMMENDED)

Create permanent redirects from old service pages to relevant new pages:

**Redirect Mapping:**

1. **`/observability`** → **`/platform-modernization`**
   - Rationale: Observability is now integrated into Platform Modernization (Pillar 4: "Observable Foundations")

2. **`/compliance-governance`** → **`/platform-modernization`**
   - Rationale: Governance as Code is a pillar in Platform Modernization
   - Alternative: Could redirect to all 4 pages via a "Compliance is built into all our services" landing page

3. **`/cloud-strategy-cost-optimization`** → **`/platform-modernization`**
   - Rationale: Cloud-Native Refactoring and Cost Predictability are covered in Platform Modernization

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Example redirect configuration (adjust based on your routing setup)
const redirects = {
  '/observability': '/platform-modernization',
  '/compliance-governance': '/platform-modernization',
  '/compliance-and-governance': '/platform-modernization',
  '/cloud-strategy-cost-optimization': '/platform-modernization',
  '/cloud-strategy': '/platform-modernization',
  '/cost-optimization': '/platform-modernization'
};
```

**Include Redirect Notice (Optional):**
Add a dismissible banner at the top of the redirected-to page:
```
"Looking for [Observability/Compliance/Cloud Strategy]? We've integrated these capabilities into our core services. Learn more below."
```

---

### Option B: 404 Page with Helpful Guidance (Alternative)

If redirects aren't feasible, create a custom 404 page that:
- Explains service consolidation
- Shows the 4 current services with links
- Provides search functionality
- Includes contact CTA

---

### Option C: Archive Pages (Least Recommended)

Keep the 3 eliminated service pages but:
- Remove from all navigation
- Add banner: "This service is now integrated into [Platform Modernization]. Visit our updated service page."
- Add noindex meta tag to prevent SEO indexing
- Link to relevant new service page

---

## SITEMAP UPDATES

**Remove from sitemap.xml:**
- `/observability`
- `/compliance-governance`
- `/cloud-strategy-cost-optimization`

**Ensure in sitemap.xml:**
- `/platform-modernization`
- `/salesforce-crm-strategy`
- `/ai-powered-productivity-automation`
- `/devex-devops`

---

## SEO CONSIDERATIONS

### Meta Tags for Redirected Pages

If using 301 redirects, ensure proper HTTP status codes:
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://www.pnwcloudservices.com/platform-modernization
```

### Update Canonical URLs

Ensure all 4 remaining service pages have correct canonical tags:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.pnwcloudservices.com/platform-modernization" />
```

### Update robots.txt (if needed)

If archiving old pages instead of redirecting:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /observability
Disallow: /compliance-governance
Disallow: /cloud-strategy-cost-optimization
```

---

## INTERNAL LINK AUDIT

### Search Entire Codebase For:

**Links to eliminated services:**
```
/observability
/compliance-governance
/compliance-and-governance
/cloud-strategy
/cost-optimization
```

**Update or remove these links from:**
- Blog posts (if any reference these services)
- About page
- Case studies
- Any "Related Services" sections
- Testimonials/quotes that mention specific services
- Any hardcoded navigation arrays
- Any service comparison tables

---

## ANALYTICS & TRACKING

### Update Google Analytics (if applicable)

**Goals/Events to Update:**
- Remove conversion tracking for eliminated service page visits
- Update service page goal funnels to reflect 4 services only
- Create new dashboard view showing 4-service navigation

### Update Tag Manager (if applicable)

**Remove or update tags for:**
- Observability page view events
- Compliance page view events
- Cloud Strategy page view events
