Role: Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Lead UX/UI Designer.

Objective: Redesign and populate all service pages (referencing the content/ directory filenames) using a consistent, human-centered "Vertical Solution Architecture."

1. Visual System & Global Contrast Updates
To solve for the over-reliance on green and white, implement these visual rules across all service pages:

The "Contrast Anchor": Every page must feature at least one full-width section with a Dark Forest Green background and white text (typically for "Proof" or "Success Story" modules).

The "Speed" Gradient: Use the pink-to-cyan linear gradient for:

Icon accents and "Strategic Benefit" card borders.

Progress bars or "Architecture Flow" lines.

A 3px bottom border on the active link in the sticky sub-navigation.

Imagery: Use duotone images (Forest Green/Action Purple) or feathered-edge architectural diagrams that blend into the faint topographic SVG background pattern.

2. The Universal Page Architecture
All pages must follow this scroll-rhythm for consistency:

Hero: Large-scale headline (Strategic Hook) + Sub-headline (Pain Killer).

Sticky Sub-Nav: Overview | Strategy | Implementation | Proof | Contact.

The "Why" (Strategic Framework): Use AWS-style accordions to progressively disclose 3-5 high-level business benefits.

The "How" (Engineering Pillars): A staggered 2x2 grid of feature cards with stylized icons and technical deep-dives.

The Proof (Dark Anchor): High-contrast section featuring the $11B+ and 80% stats contextualized to that specific service.

The Onramp: Centered CTA using a gradient-bordered button: "I want to review my [Service Name] strategy »".

3. Specific Content Mapping by Filename
A. platform-modernization.md (Strategic/Visionary)

Hook: "Stop Rescuing Legacy Systems. Start Accelerating Your Roadmap."

Focus: Monolith decomposition, Internal Developer Platforms (IDP), and Cloud-Native refactoring.

Outcome: 80% improvement in deployment velocity.

B. crm-strategy.md (Efficiency/Revenue)

Hook: "Align Your Architecture with Your GTM Ambitions."

Focus: Salesforce Data Cloud integration, GTM flow automation, and CRM technical debt reduction.

Outcome: Fixing fragmented pipelines to secure the $1.5B+ annual revenue flow.

C. ai-automation.md (Innovation/Safety)

Hook: "Responsible AI Execution. Not Just the Hype."

Focus: Deploying intelligent agents, workflow automation, and building AI governance in regulated environments.

Outcome: Enabling safe AI adoption without trading off engineering speed.

D. devex-devops.md (Speed/Retention)

Hook: "Build the Golden Path. Let Engineers Ship."

Focus: Standardizing CI/CD, eliminating "bottleneck culture," and building self-service developer systems.

Outcome: Unlocking 100+ engineers by eliminating infrastructure toil.

E. observability.md (Reliability/Trust)

Hook: "Eliminate Blind Spots. Achieve Operational Silence."

Focus: Full-stack visibility, MTTR reduction, and real-time system health dashboarding.

Outcome: Reducing friction in high-volume frontline user experiences (e.g., T-Mobile scale).

F. compliance-governance.md (Risk/Stability)

Hook: "Frictionless Trust. Compliance at Scale."

Focus: Operationalizing TCPA, CPRA, and GDPR via "Governance as Code."

Outcome: Making AI and Cloud safe to ship in highly regulated enterprise environments.

G. cloud-strategy-cost-optimiza...md (ROI/Precision)

Hook: "Scale with Precision. Right-Size Your Future."

Focus: Eliminating idle resource waste, cloud spend auditing, and ROI-focused infrastructure roadmaps.

Outcome: Identifying $450K+ in annual savings within the first 90 days.

4. Technical & UX Requirements
Responsive: All grids must stack 1-column for mobile. The sticky sub-nav must become a horizontal pill-scroll on small viewports.

Routing: Ensure the frontend labels (e.g., "AI-Powered Productivity & Automation") match the navigation menu exactly while mapping to the correct .md backend file.

Interactivity: Implement a subtle 0.3s hover-lift on all service cards.

Integrity: Retain the existing global Header and Footer without modification. Do not include CSAT widgets.
