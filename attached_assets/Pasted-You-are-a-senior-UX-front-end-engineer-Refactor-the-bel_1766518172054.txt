You are a senior UX/front-end engineer. Refactor the “below the fold” CTA section on the Contact page to remove confusion and reduce it to ONE clear call-to-action.

CONTEXT
On /contact, there is currently a below-the-fold section with:
- Left: “Ready to talk? Get in touch.” + paragraph copy
- Right: a card titled “Schedule Appointment” containing an inner “Free Consultation” card and a button.

This feels redundant because we already have the main form above and a modal CTA elsewhere. We want a clean, single CTA block here.

GOAL
Replace the entire below-the-fold CTA section with a simple “single CTA” layout:
- One headline
- One short supporting line
- One primary button
No nested cards, no “Schedule Appointment” header, no inner “Free Consultation” card.

DESIGN SPEC
1) Section layout:
   - Desktop: 2-column, horizontally aligned (text on left, button on right), vertically centered.
   - Mobile: stacked, centered, with button full-width.
2) Copy:
   - Headline: “Ready to talk?”
   - Supporting line: “Schedule a free 20-minute consultation with a platform expert.”
   - Button label: “Schedule a Free Consultation”
3) Behavior:
   - Button must open the existing consultation modal (same handler used by the header CTA).
   - Do not navigate to another page.
4) Styling:
   - Keep the current brand look (light green background, rounded corners, subtle border/shadow).
   - Remove any nested card UI; the section itself can be a single rounded container.
   - Add tasteful spacing: generous padding, clean hierarchy, no extra decorative elements.
   - Ensure accessibility: proper button focus state, readable contrast.
5) Clean up:
   - Remove unused components/markup for the old “Schedule Appointment” block.
   - Confirm there is no second “Schedule a Free Consultation” button inside this section besides the primary one.

FILES
Locate the Contact page file (likely client/src/pages/contact.tsx) and refactor the below-the-fold CTA section. If the CTA is implemented as a separate component, refactor that component instead, but keep the change scoped to the Contact page CTA area.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- On desktop, the section displays as a clean two-column CTA block with one button.
- On mobile, it stacks and the button is full-width.
- Clicking the button opens the existing consultation modal.
- No “Schedule Appointment” title or nested “Free Consultation” card remains.
- Visual result is simpler, clearer, and consistent with the rest of the site.

After implementing, provide a brief summary of which file(s) were changed and what was removed/replaced.
