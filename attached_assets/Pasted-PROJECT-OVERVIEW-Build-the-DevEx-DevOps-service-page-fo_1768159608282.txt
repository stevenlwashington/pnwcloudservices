PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build the DevEx & DevOps service page for PNW Cloud Services with updated copy, platform-as-product positioning, and developer experience emphasis. This page targets CTOs, VP Engineering, Directors of Platform Engineering, and Procurement Managers who need to build internal platforms that engineers actually want to use.

BRAND & COLOR SYSTEM REFERENCE
Use Existing Color Palette

Reference the established PNW Cloud Services brand system:

Primary Colors:

Light mint green: #e8f5e9, #f1f8f4, #e0f2f1 (backgrounds, hero sections)

Dark forest green: #064e3b, #065f46 (CTAs, text, footer)

Cream/off-white: #fafafa, #ffffff (card backgrounds)

Accent Colors:

Pink/magenta gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #ec4899 0%, #f97316 100%) - USE ONLY FOR METRICS/NUMBERS

Blue-green gradient: linear-gradient(to right, #2563eb 0%, #059669 100%) - USE FOR ALL PRIMARY HOVER STATES

Teal: #14b8a6, #10b981 - Secondary accents, borders

Light variations: #d1fae5 (icon backgrounds), #5eead4 (subtle UI accents only)

Text Colors:

Primary text: #111827, #1f2937

Secondary text: #6b7280, #4b5563

White text: #ffffff (on dark backgrounds)

Color Usage Rules

Pink gradient ONLY for metrics/numbers (4x, 85%, 40%, etc.)

Blue-green gradient for ALL PRIMARY interactive hover states (CTAs, cards, links)

Light mint backgrounds for hero and main sections (NOT dark green)

Teal for borders and dividers

Dark green for primary CTAs (solid) that transition to blue-green gradient on hover

Use solid teal #5eead4 ONLY for subtle UI affordances (icons, dividers, secondary emphasis), not primary hover states

METRICS & CLAIMS RULE (IMPORTANT)

All metrics represent typical outcomes observed across prior engagements and/or industry benchmarks. Do not present these metrics as guarantees or promises. Avoid absolute claims like “zero incidents” unless clearly framed as aspirational targets or controlled-scope outcomes.

PAGE STRUCTURE & COPY
1. HEADER/NAVIGATION (REUSE EXISTING SHARED COMPONENT — DO NOT MODIFY)

Logo: Cloud icon + "PNW Cloud Services" text (left aligned)

Navigation: Services (dropdown), Blog, Contact

Primary CTA button: "Schedule a Free Consultation"

Sticky header with subtle shadow on scroll

CTA button: Dark green solid → blue-green gradient on hover

Navigation Dropdown Should Include All Services:

Platform Modernization

Salesforce & CRM Strategy

AI-Powered Productivity & Automation

DevEx & DevOps ← Current page, show active state

Observability

Compliance & Governance

Cloud Strategy & Cost Optimization

2. HERO SECTION

Background: Light mint green gradient (linear-gradient(135deg, #e8f5e9 0%, #f1f8f4 50%, #e0f2f1 100%))
Layout: Two-column grid (text left, visual right)

Copy:

Headline (Large, Bold): "Build Internal Platforms Engineers Actually Want to Use."

Subhead (XL text): "We design developer experiences that engineers choose—not because they're mandated, but because they make shipping features faster, safer, and more sustainable than any alternative."

Primary CTA: "Get Your DevEx Assessment →" (dark green → blue-green gradient hover)

Hero Visual (Right Side):
Create a visual showing developer platform experience:

Concept: "Golden Path" visualization - a smooth, clear pathway vs. a tangled/blocked alternative route
Visual style:

Left/top: Tangled lines, warning icons, stop signs (representing friction, bottlenecks, manual approvals)

Arrow/flow showing transformation

Right/bottom: Clean, straight path with checkmarks, smooth flow (representing automated, self-service)

Alternative concept: Developer at computer with connected tools/services around them (IDE, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring) all flowing smoothly
Keep it clean, professional, iconographic (not illustration-heavy)
Colors: Use greens for "good path," grays/reds for "friction path"

3. DEVEX STRATEGY SECTION

Background: White

Section Intro:

Headline (4XL, Bold): "DevEx as a Strategic Investment"

Subhead (XL, gray text): "Developer experience isn't a luxury—it's a multiplier. Every hour of friction you remove compounds across your engineering organization. Treat your internal developer platform as a product with real users—your engineers."

Layout: Three-column card grid

Card 1: Velocity Without Sacrifice

Card Style:

Background: Subtle gradient from-emerald-50 to-teal-50

Border: border-emerald-100

Hover: Shadow lift, subtle scale

Icon: Circle background #d1fae5, icon #065f46 (use a speed/rocket icon combined with shield/checkmark)

Copy:

Headline: "Velocity Without Sacrifice"

Body: "Ship faster and safer—automated quality gates, continuous testing, and intelligent rollback strategies mean speed doesn't come at the cost of reliability. We build CI/CD pipelines where quality is a default outcome, not a heroic effort. Deploy with confidence, knowing that every release has passed the same rigorous checks without slowing down your team."

Impact Box (white background, emerald border):

Label: "Impact:" (small, emerald)

Metric: "4x faster" (2XL, bold, PINK GRADIENT)

Description: "deployment frequency with 60% fewer incidents" (small, gray)

Card 2: Platforms Engineers Choose

Card Style:

Background: Subtle gradient from-blue-50 to-cyan-50

Border: border-blue-100

Icon: Circle background #dbeafe, icon #1e40af (use a star/quality icon representing preference/adoption)

Copy (updated language only):

Headline: "Platforms Engineers Choose"

Body: "Internal platforms that engineers consistently adopt—because they're faster, clearer, and more empowering than workarounds. We measure developer satisfaction, gather feedback, and iterate on tooling just like you do for customer-facing products. When your platform reduces friction instead of creating it, retention and engagement follow. Great tooling isn't just about productivity—it's about building long-term team stability."

Impact Box (white background, blue border):

Label: "Impact:"

Metric: "85%" (2XL, bold, PINK GRADIENT)

Description: "developer satisfaction with platform tools" (small, gray)

Card 3: Self-Service Without Chaos

Card Style:

Background: Subtle gradient from-purple-50 to-pink-50

Border: border-purple-100

Icon: Circle background #e9d5ff, icon #6b21a8 (use a key or unlock icon representing autonomy)

Copy (updated language only where needed for claims):

Headline: "Self-Service Without Chaos"

Body: "Engineers provision environments, deploy to production, and manage resources independently—all within guardrails that maintain security and compliance. We eliminate the bottlenecks: manual approvals replaced by policy-as-code, knowledge silos transformed into self-service documentation, days of waiting replaced by instant provisioning. Autonomy that scales without creating risk."

Impact Box (white background, purple border):

Label: "Impact:"

Metric: "Days → Hours" (2XL, bold, PINK GRADIENT)

Description: "for environment provisioning with improved reliability" (small, gray)

Link: "Learn more →" (emerald text, arrow shifts on hover)

Pillar 2: Quality-First Delivery Pipelines

Icon: Pipeline with checkmarks icon
Copy:

Headline: "Quality-First Delivery Pipelines"

Body: "Build CI/CD pipelines where quality gates are automated, not optional. Shift security left, catch bugs before production, and make reliability a default outcome—not a heroic effort. Every deploy passes the same rigorous checks without manual intervention."

Link: "Learn more →"

Pillar 3: Developer-Centric Platform Design

Icon: User/person with tools icon
Copy:

Headline: "Developer-Centric Platform Design"

Body: "Treat internal platforms like products—measure satisfaction, gather feedback, iterate relentlessly. Engineers adopt platforms they choose, not platforms they're forced to use. We apply product thinking to internal tooling, ensuring your platform evolves with your team's needs."

Link: "Learn more →"

Pillar 4: Friction Elimination & Autonomy

Icon: Barrier removal or unlock icon
Copy:

Headline: "Friction Elimination & Autonomy"

Body: "Identify and remove bottlenecks—human approvals replaced by policy-as-code, knowledge silos transformed into self-service documentation, waiting replaced by instant provisioning. Give engineers the autonomy to move fast within boundaries that maintain security and compliance."

Link: "Learn more →"

5. PROVEN IMPACT SECTION
