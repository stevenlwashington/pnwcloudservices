Please apply the following enhancements across the entire website.

1. HERO SECTION — Add Gradient Text

Update the hero headline on the Home page:

"Enterprise platforms that power AI, efficiency, and growth."

Enhancements:

Apply a soft multicolor gradient similar to the “Product thinking.” text from the reference screenshot I provided.

Suggested gradient: soft purple → pink → warm orange (very subtle, enterprise-friendly).

Keep the second line (if split) in solid dark text for contrast.

Ensure gradient affects text only, not background.

2. AI ACCENT COLOR LOGIC

Introduce a unified accent color scheme:

Any tag, badge, icon, or phrase involving “AI”, “Automation,” or “Machine Learning” should use a soft purple accent (#7A5AF8 or nearest match to your palette).

Apply this to:

AI service page tags

Blog AI category chip

AI Automation page section headers

Any callouts specifically referring to AI

This should be subtle. Do NOT oversaturate.

3. CTA UNIIFICATION + MODAL CONVERSION
A. Standardize CTA Text

Replace all variations with a single unified version:

➡️ “Schedule a Consultation”

Check ALL locations:

Header

Home page

Footer

Blog cards (if any)

Contact page

Any buttons generated in services pages

B. Convert CTA → Modal

When a user clicks Schedule a Consultation, open a modal instead of navigating to the Contact page.

The modal should contain the existing contact form, including:

Name

Business email

Company

Job title

How did you hear about us?

Project description

Submit button

Modal design guidelines:

White background

Soft drop shadow

Slight rounded corners (12–16px)

Close button (X) in top right

Prevent background scrolling while open

Make the modal responsive for mobile

Keep the standalone Contact page available via the nav link.

4. UPDATE CONSULTATION INFO

Apply these global changes wherever consultation messaging appears:

Remove the $99 pricing entirely from the site.

Replace any consultation time references with:
“Free 20-minute consultation.”

Update the Contact page block that references appointment scheduling.

5. FOOTER UPDATE

In the footer’s copyright line:

Replace:

© 2025 Pacific Northwest Cloud Services. All rights reserved.


With:

© 2025 Pacific Northwest Cloud Services LLC. All rights reserved.


Do not alter the footer layout.

6. DESIGN SYSTEM POLISH

Apply the following improvements globally:

A. Color Enhancements

Maintain green as the primary brand color.

Add subtle purple as a secondary AI accent where appropriate.

Use a consistent gray scale for borders & muted text.

B. Typography Refinements

Slightly increase line-height for body text.

Tighten letter-spacing for headline fonts.

Ensure consistent H1–H4 sizing across all pages.

C. Button Styling

All primary buttons should follow the same styling:

Green background (#1F6C3F or site’s current primary)

White text

Slight hover darken effect

Rounded corners (10–12px)

Font weight semi-bold

Secondary buttons (if used):

White background

Green border

Green text

Subtle hover fill

7. SUBTLE ANIMATIONS

Add gentle UX-friendly animations:

Fade-in for hero text on page load

Slight upward motion (5–10px) for cards on hover

Smooth dropdown animation for desktop nav

Mobile drawer slide-in animation

Animations must be subtle, professional, and low-performance-cost.

8. IMAGE PLACEHOLDER COMPONENTS

Add placeholder components where imagery is expected in the future:

For Service Pages:

Platform Modernization → add a placeholder for a modernization diagram

AI Automation → placeholder for an AI workflow graphic

DevEx & DevOps → placeholder for CI/CD pipeline diagram

Observability → placeholder for an observability dashboard mockup

Use a neutral box with text like:
“Image placeholder — coming soon.”

Ensure they match the site’s color palette and are easy to swap later.

9. BLOG GRID REFINEMENT

Standardize blog featured images to a consistent aspect ratio (16:9 preferred).

Add a subtle hover zoom (1–2% scale) on blog cards.

Ensure all category badges follow the new color rules.

10. CODE CLEANUP & CONSISTENCY

Please do the following globally:

Remove unused imports created during page generation

Standardize spacing between components (32–48px vertical rhythm)

Ensure all pages use consistent container widths

Consolidate repeated styles into shared components or utility classes

✔ When finished

Please output:

List of all files created/edited

Any places where manual content or direction is needed

Confirmation that the modal CTA works across desktop & mobile
