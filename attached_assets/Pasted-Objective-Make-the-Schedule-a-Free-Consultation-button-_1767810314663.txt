Objective:
Make the “Schedule a Free Consultation” button use the exact same hover glow behavior as the Service Cards (e.g., “Salesforce & CRM Strategy”), including gradient colors, blur, opacity, spread, timing, and interaction model.

Do NOT invent a new glow. Reuse the existing service-card glow pattern verbatim.

Context:
The Service Cards implement their glow using an absolutely positioned gradient div inside a `group` wrapper with Tailwind CSS utilities.

Current Service Card Glow (reference implementation):
<div className="absolute -inset-1 rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-cyan-400 to-emerald-500 opacity-0 blur-lg transition-opacity duration-300 group-hover:opacity-60" />

Tasks:
1. Locate the “Schedule a Free Consultation” button component (used in:
   - Top navigation CTA
   - Hero section CTA
   - Bottom-of-page CTA)

2. Wrap the button in a `relative group` container, exactly like the Service Cards.

3. Add an absolutely positioned glow div BEHIND the button using the SAME Tailwind classes:
   - bg-gradient-to-r
   - from-blue-500 via-cyan-400 to-emerald-500
   - blur-lg
   - -inset-1
   - opacity-0 → group-hover:opacity-60
   - transition-opacity duration-300
   - matching border radius (rounded-xl or rounded-2xl depending on button size)

4. Ensure layering is correct:
   - Glow div uses `absolute` positioning
   - Button uses `relative z-10`
   - Glow sits behind the button but above the page background

5. Match interaction behavior:
   - Hover (desktop): glow fades in smoothly
   - Focus (keyboard): glow appears for accessibility
   - Touch (mobile): glow appears on tap/active state

6. Do NOT:
   - Change button text
   - Change button size, padding, or typography
   - Introduce shadows or effects not used on service cards
   - Increase glow opacity beyond 60%

7. Result:
   - The “Schedule a Free Consultation” button should be visually indistinguishable from a Service Card hover glow, just applied to a button shape.
   - Same gradient, same blur, same timing, same intensity.

Deliverable:
- Updated button component code with the glow implemented
- Reuse existing Tailwind utilities (no new CSS files unless absolutely required)
