# DevEx & DevOps

## Hero
**Title:** DevEx & DevOps built as a product.  
**Subtitle:**  
CI/CD pipelines, frictionless developer workflows, and DORA metrics that translate into real business outcomes.  
**Primary CTA:** Evaluate your pipeline  
**Secondary CTA:** Improve developer experience

## Why DevEx Matters
Developer experience is one of the strongest predictors of:

- Velocity  
- Quality  
- Talent retention  
- Innovation  
- Ability to adopt AI  

If developers are frustrated, the business slows down.  
If developers can move freely, the business accelerates.

## Philosophy: Platform as a Product
We design DevEx the same way great companies design customer experiences:

- Clear paved paths  
- Self-service tooling  
- Low-friction environments  
- Strong documentation  
- Consistent workflows  
- Good defaults that scale

## Toolchain We Support
We work with tools your teams already use:

- VSCode  
- GitLab  
- Gearset (Salesforce DevOps)  
- Jira  
- Slack  
- Splunk  
- Functionize

## CI/CD & Release Automation
We build pipelines that:

- Reduce release times from days to minutes  
- Automate testing and code validation  
- Improve deployment reliability  
- Work seamlessly for Salesforce + cloud engineering teams  
- Support feature flags and rapid iteration  

---

## DORA Metrics as Business Outcomes
We measure DevEx by outcomes such as:

- **Lead time to change**  
- **Deployment frequency**  
- **Change failure rate**  
- **Mean time to restore (MTTR)**  

…and translate these into:

- Faster GTM response  
- Better customer satisfaction  
- Lower operational costs
