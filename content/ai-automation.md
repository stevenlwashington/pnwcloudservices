## Section 1 — Why AI has to start with your platforms

Most teams don’t fail at AI because the models are bad.  
They fail because:

- The data feeding those models is incomplete or messy  
- The workflows around AI are bolted on instead of designed in  
- No one is clear on how to measure success beyond “we built a cool demo”  

PNW Cloud Services starts with your **platforms, data, and GTM systems**—then layers AI in a way that is:

- Grounded in clear business outcomes  
- Respectful of compliance and governance (TCPA, CPRA, internal policies)  
- Sustainable for your engineering and operations teams

## Section 2 — AI Sales Agents (B2B and B2C)

### What we build

We design AI Sales Agents that act like an always-on extension of your GTM team, not a random chatbot bolted to your website.

**Examples include:**

- **B2B AI Sales Agents**
  - Qualify inbound leads using existing data and behavioral signals  
  - Route to the right reps based on territory, segment, or product line  
  - Draft personalized outreach and follow-ups that match your tone and brand  
  - Update Salesforce or your CRM automatically with key callouts and next steps  

- **B2C AI Sales Agents**
  - Guide customers through complex product choices  
  - Answer pre-purchase questions using trusted, curated knowledge  
  - Hand off to human agents gracefully when needed  
  - Capture intent and feedback to improve journeys over time  

### What this can achieve

- Faster speed-to-lead and response times  
- Higher conversion on qualified traffic  
- Better signal for marketing, product, and revenue operations

## Section 3 — AI-Embedded Product Analytics & Insights

You don’t need more dashboards—you need better questions and faster answers.

PNW Cloud Services helps you embed AI into your **product analytics and behavioral data**, so you can:

- Segment users by behavior and outcome, not just basic demographics  
- Identify friction in onboarding, critical workflows, and feature adoption  
- Surface patterns that would take analysts weeks to find manually  
- Generate narratives and summaries that product leaders can act on immediately  

We can work with tools and data sources such as:

- Product analytics and telemetry  
- CRM and GTM systems  
- Data platforms and warehouses  

The goal: shorten the loop between **signal → insight → decision → change**.

## Section 4 — AI for Product Management & Roadmapping

AI isn’t going to replace your product managers.  
But it can absolutely take friction out of their day.

We help teams use AI to:

- Generate structured user stories and acceptance criteria from raw notes or transcripts  
- Draft PRDs and requirement docs that PMs can refine instead of start from scratch  
- Propose roadmap options and tradeoffs based on goals and constraints  
- Summarize feedback from customers, sales, and support into themes and opportunities  

The result is not “auto-pilot product management.”  
It’s **more time spent talking to customers and shaping strategy**, and less time wrangling documents.

## Section 5 — The AI stack we work with

We’re vendor-aware but not vendor-locked.

Depending on your environment and needs, we can work with:

- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** for general-purpose LLMs and copilots  
- **Anthropic (Claude)** for safer, long-context reasoning and analysis  
- **Google Gemini** integrated where it fits your stack  
- **Glean** for enterprise search and knowledge retrieval  
- Developer tooling such as **Replit** for rapid experimentation and prototyping  

We align the stack to:

- Your data residency and compliance requirements  
- Your security posture and governance standards  
- Your existing platforms and investments  

---

## Section 6 — Responsible AI, by design

You can’t separate AI from governance anymore.

Every AI engagement with PNW Cloud Services considers:

- **Data governance:** What data are we using, and should we be using it this way?  
- **Privacy & regulation:** How do TCPA, CPRA, and internal policies shape our solution?  
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Where do people make final decisions or QA the system?  
- **Measurement:** How do we know this AI system is helping, not hurting?  

We design AI solutions that are:

- Traceable: You understand how they work and what data they rely on  
- Tunable: You can improve them over time without rewriting everything  
- Accountable: You know who owns outcomes internally  

---

## Section 7 — How we work with you

A typical AI-powered productivity engagement looks like:

1. **Discovery & alignment**  
   - Clarify your goals, constraints, and success metrics  
   - Inventory relevant data sources and platforms  

2. **Design & architecture**  
   - Define user journeys, system boundaries, and governance  
   - Propose stack and integration approach  

3. **Build & integrate**  
   - Implement AI workflows, integrations, and UX touchpoints  
   - Add telemetry and measurement  

4. **Launch & iterate**  
   - Validate impact against KPIs  
   - Tune prompts, models, and workflows based on real usage
