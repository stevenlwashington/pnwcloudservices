## What Observability Really Means
Most dashboards tell teams **what** happened.  
Few systems explain **why** it happened.

PNW Cloud Services designs observability systems that:

- Reveal bottlenecks  
- Improve incident response  
- Reduce blind spots  
- Tie engineering work to business outcomes  
- Power data for AI systems

## Tools & Signals We Work With
- Splunk  
- DataDog  
- Pendo (behavior & telemetry)  
- Custom log/metric pipelines  

We support logs, metrics, traces, behavioral data, product telemetry, and reliability signals.

## DORA Metrics Deep Dive
DORA metrics help leaders understand:

- **Lead time to change** — how fast we can safely ship  
- **Deployment frequency** — how often value reaches customers  
- **Change failure rate** — how often releases break things  
- **MTTR** — how long recovery takes  

When these metrics move, the **business moves**:

- Lower costs  
- Higher reliability  
- More revenue  
- Faster GTM response

## Dashboard Mockup (Narrative)
Imagine a dashboard that shows:

- Lead time reduced from weeks → hours  
- Change failure rate cut in half  
- Reduced MTTR after incidents  
- Happier engineers, fewer fire drills  
- Clear ROI for leadership  

That’s what we build.
