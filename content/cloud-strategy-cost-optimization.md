## Why Cloud Strategy Needs a Reset
Most companies overspend by:

- Running workloads on the wrong services  
- Keeping legacy systems alive  
- Overprovisioning compute  
- Not consolidating platforms  
- Not tuning storage strategy  
- Shipping inefficient workflows  

We fix all of this with a strategy aligned to your business.

## Cost Optimization That Actually Works
We analyze:

- Compute patterns  
- Storage footprint  
- Data lifecycle  
- Pipeline inefficiencies  
- Duplicate tooling  
- Cloud → CRM → GTM interplay  

We helped one enterprise reduce **$450K+ annually** in storage & compute.

Additional savings opportunities often follow modernization.

## Productivity Impacts
Savings are only half the story.

We also improve:

- Engineering velocity  
- Seller productivity  
- Service agent workflows  
- Customer-facing experience  

Your cloud strategy becomes a **platform advantage**.

## Target Cloud Stack

…and support Azure/GCP when relevant.
